# Presentation Design Principles

Detailed design framework for creating professional presentations. This file is loaded on-demand when deeper design guidance is needed.

## 1. Ten Evidence-Based Rules

From PLOS Computational Biology: [Ten Simple Rules for Effective Presentation Slides](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8638955/)

1. **One idea per slide** — Each slide conveys exactly one core message
2. **One minute per slide** — 20-minute talk ≈ 20 slides
3. **Title = assertion** — Change "Results" to "X proves Y" — the title is the abstract
4. **Only include what you'll discuss** — If you won't talk about it, remove it
5. **Cite inline** — Attribution goes on the slide, not a final references slide
6. **Lead with visuals** — Almost no slide should be text-only; build around images/charts
7. **Avoid cognitive overload** — Text is "signpost" not "full text"; ≤6 elements per slide
8. **Distraction test** — A distracted viewer should still grasp the point from the slide alone
9. **Iterate through practice** — Rehearse to confirm flow and transitions
10. **Design for disaster** — PDF backup, screenshots instead of video, avoid animations

## 2. Assertion-Evidence Framework

Developed by Michael Alley at Penn State. Controlled experiment with 110 engineering students showed this approach produces:
- Better comprehension
- Fewer misconceptions
- Lower perceived cognitive load
- Better delayed recall

**Core method:** Slide titles are complete assertion sentences, not topic words.

| Traditional | Assertion-Evidence |
|------------|-------------------|
| Q3 Sales | Q3 sales grew 23%, driven by new users |
| Methodology | We validated this hypothesis with a double-blind experiment |
| Key Findings | Three patterns emerged from 10,000 user sessions |

## 3. Information Density

### 5/5/5 Rule
- ≤5 words per line
- ≤5 bullet points per slide
- No more than 5 text-heavy slides in a row

### Aggressive variant (recommended)
- ≤4 bullet points per slide
- ≤4 information units per bullet
- Short-term memory holds ~7 items (Miller's Law)

### Cognitive load evidence
Eye-tracking research shows: when a slide has 1 bullet point, viewers read it completely. As bullets accumulate, viewers only skim a fraction. Text-heavy slides overload the visual channel, preventing the verbal channel from processing the speaker's narration. Slides and speech should complement, not duplicate.

## 4. Color Systems

### 60-30-10 Rule
- 60% dominant (background — light or dark)
- 30% secondary (text, shapes)
- 10% accent (highlights, CTA, key data)

### Palette Presets (18 options)

**Professional:**

| Name | Background | Text | Accent | Use case |
|------|-----------|------|--------|----------|
| Corporate Blue | #FFFFFF | #2D3436 | #0984E3 | Business, consulting |
| Dark Tech | #1A1A2E | #E0E0E0 | #4ECDC4 | Tech, SaaS |
| Warm Trust | #FDF6EC | #3D3D3D | #E17055 | Education, coaching |
| Clean Minimal | #F8F9FA | #212529 | #6C63FF | Startup, product |

**Bold:**

| Name | Background | Text | Accent | Use case |
|------|-----------|------|--------|----------|
| High Contrast | #000000 | #FFFFFF | #FF6B6B | Keynote, impact |
| Electric | #0D0D0D | #F0F0F0 | #00FF88 | Tech demo, launch |
| Royal | #1B1464 | #FFFFFF | #FFD93D | Premium, luxury |

**Nature/Health:**

| Name | Background | Text | Accent | Use case |
|------|-----------|------|--------|----------|
| Forest | #F0F4F0 | #2D3436 | #00B894 | Eco, sustainability |
| Ocean | #EBF5FB | #1A5276 | #48C9B0 | Health, wellness |
| Sunset | #FFF5E6 | #2C3E50 | #E74C3C | Energy, passion |

**Gradient:**

| Name | Start→End | Text | Accent |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Deep Space | #0F0C29→#302B63 | #FFFFFF | #FFD93D |
| Aurora | #0F2027→#2C5364 | #FFFFFF | #4ECDC4 |
| Dusk | #2C3E50→#FD746C | #FFFFFF | #F8E71C |

### 2025-2026 Trends
- Dark mode (black/navy + bright text): premium feel, reduced eye strain
- Gradient revival: blue-purple, orange-pink as backgrounds or title slides
- Warm neutrals replacing cold grays: earth tones, sage green, deep plum
- High-contrast neon accents (lime green, electric blue) on dark backgrounds
- Classic combos: blue+white (trust), blue+yellow (attention), mint+gray (modern)

**High contrast is non-negotiable.** Text/graphics must stand out clearly against the background.

## 5. Typography

### Core Rules
- Max 2 font families (1 heading + 1 body)
- Heading: bold, personality — ≥36pt (2026 trend: even larger)
- Body: clean, readable — ≥24pt
- Avoid: italics, underlines, ALL CAPS (except very short labels)
- Consider colorblind-friendly palettes

### Recommended Fonts

| Role | English | Chinese |
|------|---------|---------|
| Heading | Montserrat, Georgia | PingFang SC Bold, Source Han Sans Bold |
| Body | Inter, Helvetica Neue, Arial | PingFang SC Regular, Source Han Sans Regular |

### 2026 Typography Trends
- Oversized typography as visual hero element
- Clean sans-serif remains the readability standard
- Expressive/display fonts acceptable for title slides only
- Variable fonts gaining adoption for weight flexibility

## 6. Layout and Whitespace

### Reading Patterns
- Western audiences follow F-pattern (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) or Z-pattern scanning
- Place headline prominently at top; supporting content below
- Use whitespace to separate information blocks

### Whitespace Principles
- Whitespace improves memory retention, attention, and perceived professionalism
- Important elements need breathing room around them
- Whitespace is not waste — it's functional design

### Content Distribution
- Title:body size ratio ≈ 3:1
- Minimize pure-text slides; every slide should have a visual element
- 30-50-20 content split: 30% opening, 50% body, 20% closing
- Data-heavy slides: use charts over tables
- Visuals carry the message; text provides navigation

## 7. Viral Deck Framework (Sabrina Ramonov)

Three-tier system for high-impact presentations:

### Tier 1: Fundamentals
- Visual-first, minimal text
- ≤8 words per title
- One idea per slide
- 3-color palette: white/black/accent

### Tier 2: Visual Metaphors + Data Viz
Five viral layouts:
1. **Hero** — Full-bleed image + overlay text
2. **Contrast** — Before/after or dual-panel
3. **Icon Grid** — 3-6 icons with short labels
4. **Quote Focus** — Large quote + attribution
5. **Process Flow** — Step-by-step horizontal or vertical

### Tier 3: Advanced System (14 layouts)
Adds: Timeline, Before/After, Anatomy Breakdown, Comparison Matrix, plus a complete typographic system and "anti-hallucination safety rules."

Core insight: "Viral decks are not visually loud. They are intellectually loud. Say something new, interesting, and emotionally compelling."
